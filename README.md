# Cole Baty's Github Repo

Hi, I'm Cole.  I'm a Cybersecurity professional, getting a start in the industry
after a mid-life career pivot.

I graduated from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia in May of 2024 with
a Bachelor of Science in Cyber Operations. This GitHub repo is my portfolio, showcasing
the projects I've worked on since starting my degree in 2021.

Hopefully, if you're looking at this page, it's because I've applied for a job
with your company.  Please feel free to dig in - I'd be happy to answer any
questions in an interview! 

Please find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-baty/)!
